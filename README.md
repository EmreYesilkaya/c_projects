# Company Sales Analysis Project for YBS116 

## Introduction
This project, developed for an Algorithms course, features a C program that simulates and analyzes sales data for three different companies over a 12-month period. It demonstrates the application of basic programming constructs in C and algorithms for data analysis.

## Features
- **Random Sales Data Generation**: Simulates monthly sales figures for three different companies.
- **Sales Comparison**: Identifies the month with the highest sales for each company.
- **Total Sales Calculation**: Computes total sales for all companies and for specific months as chosen by the user.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to input a specific month and receive detailed sales data for that month.

## How to Run the Program
To run this program, you need a C compiler installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.c` file.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler, e.g., `gcc main.c -o salesAnalysis`.
4. Run the executable: `./salesAnalysis`.

## Usage
Upon running the program, follow the on-screen prompts. First, the program will display the total sales for all companies and the highest monthly sales. Then, you will be prompted to enter a month number (1-12) to view sales data for that specific month.
